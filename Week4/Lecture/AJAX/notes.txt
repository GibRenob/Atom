AJAX
	- What is it?
		- Asynchronous Javascript And XML
		- AJAJ - AJA JSON

		- AJAX allows us to build applications that can send / retrieve data in the background
			- NO page refreshes
			- We don't lose state on the webpage
			- Faster
				- We're only loading DATA, NOT HTML, CSS, JS, and data
			- Separation of concerns
				- Allows you to have a bigger distinction between client (front-end) and server (back-end)

			- Refresh / Back button :(
			- Need to consider UX even more
			- Remember : JavaScript can be disabled!

HTTP
	- We can make HTTP requests to servers

	1. Client sends REQUEST
		- Asking for data
		- Sending data to server
	2. Server does something with the REQUEST
		- Retrieve info from DB
		- Add new data to DB
	3. Server sends down a RESPONSE to the client
		- Servers MUST send a response
		- Servers may send data down as well as a status code
			2-300 range are OK codes
			4-500 range are BAD codes
			418 - I'm a teapot
			420 - Enhance your calm
	4. Client handles data from the RESPONSE

	All HTTP requests have a METHOD (verbs)

	GET -
		- Asking servers for data without modifying anything
		- Common GET requests
			: Entering a URL into the browser
			: Click on a link
		- GET requests send information in whats called the QUERY STRING
		http://google.com?search=pokemon

	POST -
		 - Sending data to a server to CREATE new data
		 - POST requests send information in whats called the REQUEST BODY
		 http://google.com
		 - Examples of POST
		 	: Creating a facebook status
		 	: signing up for a website
		 	: Adding a recipe to a recipe site

	PUT -
		- Sending data to the server to MODIFY existing data

	DELETE -
		   - Deleting data


	CRUD - NOT a 1:1 relationship with HTTP methods OR REST
		- Create  - POST
		- Read    - GET
		- Update  - PUT
		- Delete  - DELETE
