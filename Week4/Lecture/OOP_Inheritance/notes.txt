OOP Inheritance

	- Creating a hierarchy of classes

2 kinds of relationships
	is a
	has a

menus HAVE SOME plates
plates HAVE SOME foodItems
restaurant HAS A menu

dog IS A mammal
whale IS A mammal

IS A relationships are a good use case for inheritance.  This is because there are probably common properties or methods they might share

Even if you have an IS A relationship, only use inheritance to save yourself code

Inheritance Chain
	- The vertical relationship between classes
	- An object, when we call a method on it, will first access itself to see if it has that method
	- If that property doesn't exist, it will then look to its PROTOTYPE
	- If it doesn't exist on its OWN prototype, it will look at that prototype's prototype
	- Repeat the above step until you hit the Object class in JS
